This directory contains the data from the 3 experiments run by Elad

The file combined.csv contains the error measures - both those calcualated by the software, as well as the measures used in the "evaluation" project

The matlab codes generates the .csv files, based on the xml data in the 2023_XX_XX directories, and then combines the data from the .h5 files (produced during the experiment) with the additional measures.

The file combined.h5 is an h5 version of the .csv file
