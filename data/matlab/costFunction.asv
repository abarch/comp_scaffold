% The cost function calculates the difference between the model predictions
% and the ground truth (what the teacher selected)

function cost = costFunction(weight,groundtruth,timingerror_timingpractice,timingerror_pitchpractice,pitcherror_timingpractice,pitcherror_pitchpractice)

diff_timing = data.error_after_right_timing - data.error_before_right_timing;
diff_pitch = data.error_after_right_pitch - data.error_before_right_pitch;

cost = X - groundtruth;
